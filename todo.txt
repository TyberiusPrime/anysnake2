- flakes that are paths relative to %ANYSNAKE_ROOT% ?

- poetry project in subdirectory of repo. poetry project in subdir, editable.

- clear up when we're using the github api and when we're doing git ls-remote

- under what circumstances do we rebuild the editable packages? does that still happen every time we change the python packages (shouldn't...)

- evaluate shpool as dtach replacement


- either switch from singularity, or find another way to get around the mount issues: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/293787 so we can get this thing to 24.05. 23.05 already complains as well.


-- garbage collection for poetry clones?
-- rpy2 site path hacks?
-- rpy2 needs too many buildInputs etc... maybe fix upstream in poetry2nix?
