- flakes that are paths relative to %ANYSNAKE_ROOT% ?
- poetry project in subdirectory of repo. poetry project in subdir, editable.
- why does it pull in pytest 8.1.something when you don't set pytest in 
    the just_python example
- run all the tests, fix all the examples...
 - clear up when we're using the github api and when we're doing git ls-remote
 - auto separate sections in anysnake.toml with newlines

 - test cases for
  - prefer wheels
  - prefer wheel
  ( though that stuff doesn't quite work in poetry2nix right now https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix/issues/1403 )


- under what circumstances do we rebuild the editable packages? does that still happen every time we change the python packages (shouldn't...)

- evaluate shpool as dtach replacement


- either switch from singularity, or find another way to get around the mount issues: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/293787 so we can get this thing to 24.05. 23.05 already complains as well.


-- combine prefetchers from tofu and flake writer ( one gets the path, the other doesn't...)
-- garbage collection for poetry clones?
-- rpy2 site path hacks?
-- rpy2 needs too many buildInputs etc... maybe fix upstream in poetry2nix?
