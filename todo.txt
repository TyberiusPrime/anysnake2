- flakes that are paths relative to %ANYSNAKE_ROOT% ?
- does ancientpoetry create a virtualenv? supress.
- poetry project in subdirectory of repo. poetry project in subdir, editable.
- git+ssh urls for poetry
- why does it pull in pytest 8.1.something when you don't set pytest in 
    the just_python example
- run all the tests, fix all the examples...
 - clear up when we're using the github api and when we're doing git ls-remote
 - auto separate sections in anysnake.toml with newlines

 - test cases for
  - prefer wheels
  - prefer wheel

  - the nixpkgs url is not written to the flake correctly.

- under what circumstances do we rebuild the editable packages? does that still happen every time we change the python packages (shouldn't...)

- evaluate shpool as dtach replacement


- either switch from singularity, or find another way to get around the mount issues: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/293787 so we can get this thing to 24.05. 23.05 already complains as well.
